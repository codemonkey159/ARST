ARST (automatic recoil smoothing tool) is a program to  trigger recoil smoothing while shooting in apex legends with as little side effects as possible. Recoil smoothing is a game mechanic where if you are aiming down sights and your FOV is lower than your normal looking FOV (that is, you're zoomed in) the effect of recoil is reduced when you're moving your cursor. This tool works by making small diamon shaped movements with the cursor, just enough to trigger recoil smoothing while shooting without moving your cursor.
